##### Project Description

Finding reliable health & science information on the internet is hard.
Everyone just wants to shill something. Everything that seems like an article? Actually an ad. That curated list? Totally influenced by gift baskets.

What if we could curate resources in a way that fosters transparency and accountability? In a way that is not just resistant to corruption, but actually leads to profiting off attempted scammers?

#### Research Collective

We are a non-profit/DAO of citizen scientists.

We are rallying to  curate 'under-regulated' domains such as COVID, psychedelics, and gene therapies.

For this hackathon, we focused just on hooking up Aragon DAOs with 3Box. Votes for Aragon are loaded via TheGraph and displayed in a way that people are able to see associated 3Box profiles. For instance, a vendor may be able to post a listing for their online store, and manage that listing via their 3Box profile. The Aragon DAO is used to screen submissions.

Eventually, we hope to see people staking behind their submissions to the list. That stake can be used to generate interest bearing DAI, that goes to the DAO that curates the list. The general public will be able to challenge each listing, and if the challenger is successful the listing is removed and the challenger gets the original poster's stake.
